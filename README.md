# algorithms-datastructures
University course "Algorithms and Data Structures" which I attended during my erasmus in Odense, DK
This GitHub repository stores the exercises and mid-term tests

Contents that have been learned during this course are:
- Principles of Object oriented Programming in C++
- Linked Lists like Queues, Circular Queues, Trees, Hash Tables
- Sorting algorithms like Mergesort, Bubblesort, Quicksort, Bucketsort, Heapsort
- Shortest Path Problems
- Graphs

Especially interesting may be the Knight_King mid-term exercise. Where an algorithm should be developed that finds the shortest path for a given starting and end position inside a chess field.
